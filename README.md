# Business-Analytics-Visualization-Using-Tableau
This Project uses the Adventure Work Data Warehouse for Internet Sales to create visualizations that answer key business questions. 
The goal is to explore and analyze various aspects of sales data using Tableau to answer specific questions, such as identifying the most frequent buyers by gender, income, and marital status, determining which country and city generate the most sales, and analyzing product categories with the highest unit prices.

The Project includes a series of visualizations for:

Analyzing buyer demographics (gender, income, marital status).
Identifying top-performing locations in terms of sales.
Understanding product characteristics (color, size, style).
Measuring the effectiveness of promotions.
Calculating sales margin.
Analyzing unit price by product category.
Examining shipping timelines and their relationship with product sales.
Exploring the effect of promotion duration on internet sales.
Using k-means clustering to analyze customer data by gender and income.
Finally, a dashboard is created to present a comprehensive overview of these analyses. This project helps develop skills in data visualization, data exploration, and analytics using Tableau to answer critical business questions.
